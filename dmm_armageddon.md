## Ending Stats

At this point the stats you should have are:

- 80 Strength
- 71+ Hitpoints
- 45 Prayer
- 1 Defence
- 1 Attack
- <= 54 Range/Mage

This should guarantee you don't die early. The stats left to work on are:

- 54 Range/Mage if haven't completed already.
- 75 Hitpoints
    - This will have to be done either via lamps or questing. [From 71 there is roughly ~400k experience to get to 75](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Experience). Some things to consider:
        - You can complete the quests [the fremenik isles](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Fremennik_Isles) and [one small favour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/One_Small_Favour). These each give 200k experience in a skill of your choice for the 400k needed to complete the HP.
        - [Continue collecting fossils](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Fossil_Island_fossil). You can do this in any number of ways but the most efficient is [Sulliuscep](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sulliuscep)
        - Complete [achievement diaries](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Achievement_Diary) as another source of lamps.

Depending on the route you take above you will have to lock/unlock your experience at various points. However, once you achieve the final combats stats **YOU MUST LOCK AND NEVER UNLOCK EXP THEREAFTER**.
